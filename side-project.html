            <h3>How I became known as <span class="tgbg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheGreenBayGuy" target="_blank">The Green Bay Guy</a></span> and how I grew because of it</h3>

            <div class="wrapper">
                <p>Midway through 2017 I found myself itching to take on a side hustle or side project of some sort. I was roughly a year removed from my skateboarding business that I had operated for four years, and felt like my days were becoming more mundane. My only issue was that I couldn’t figure out what I should do. I had really enjoyed starting and operating my skateboarding company, but once I moved to Green Bay the business fizzled out due to not having the same reputation in skateboarding in Green Bay as I did in my hometown. I spent a lot of my time reading and listening to lectures on YouTube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80-gPkpH6M&t=986s" target="_blank">Jim Carrey’s commencement speech</a> really stuck with me. In his speech he states that you should ask the universe for what you want, and the universe will eventually listen. I thought it was a slightly odd idea, but there was no harm in trying. So, I asked the universe to help me find what I was looking for.</p>

                <p>A few weeks after making my ask, I get a notification on Twitter. Someone tweeted me, asking me if I could message them when I get a minute. I followed the person back and sent them a quick, “What’s up?". The gentleman, named Jordan, proceeded to send me a message asking for some advice. He was taking his Grandpa to a Packers game and they were on their way to Green Bay. They had some items planned as to what to do, but wanted to reach out to me in order to make sure they knew all the places to eat or see. They were wanting to get the full Green Bay experience, as this was his Grandpa’s first Lambeau Field experience and it was his Grandpa’s dream to see the Packers play at Lambeau Field. I was more than happy to assist Jordan with this request. I quickly sent him a list of all the places I’d recommend to eat, drink, or see while in town. As he experienced these places, he would message me to let me know what he thought of each. We ended up meeting at Lambeau Field on that Sunday, where he thanked me for all the help and said it really made the trip great. It was a great feeling knowing that I was personally able to make a positive impact on someone’s trip to Green Bay.

                <p>The whole next week I kept thinking about Jordan reaching out and how great it was to make that trip more memorable for him and his grandpa. I thought to myself, if I could help Jordan, I’m sure there are a lot of others who I could help too. I concluded that a website focused solely on the best places to eat, drink, or see would be a fun little project. I sought out a name that was available on all socials, as well as an available domain. After striking out on a few names, The Green Bay Guy was the winner. Roughly a month later, my website went live. At the time, it had only a few reviews on it, but I figured it was better to launch it as quickly as possible, rather than waiting for it to be perfect. As of writing this, I now have over 50 reviews of different restaurants in the area.

                <p>The funny thing about side projects is how they continue to grow and develop. After a few months of building up a following on The Green Bay Guy, I thought of another idea. It stemmed from a visit to my grandma in her assisted living home. While there, one of the residents overheard I was from Green Bay. He proceeded to tell me that back in the 1940s he hitchhiked to Green Bay on two different occasions to watch Curly’s Packers take on the Lions and the Bears. I was in awe of the story and how farfetched the idea of hitchhiking over 200 miles to watch a football game was. After leaving I was reflecting on that story. I was bummed to think that one day he would no longer be around to share that story, and ultimately the story would end with him. I then thought of how many other people have unique stories that they could share. With this thought, I concluded that a podcast that focuses on fans and their stories would be a really fun project to work on during the offseason. While I had never made a podcast before, I figured it was something I could figure out along the way. I quickly got to work on what the name would be, potential guests, and how to even upload a podcast. I won’t bore you with all of the details, but I quickly figured out what I was doing and some guests. I named the podcast The Green Bay Narrative. In total, I interviewed over 50 people to capture their stories. The podcast did exactly what I was hoping it would – captured some very unique stories. I was even fortunate enough to interview a few different Packers players and capture their stories. If you’d like to listen to any of the episodes, you can still find them on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thegreenbaynarrative" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> or on <a href="http://thegreenbayguy.com/podcast.html" target="_blank">The Green Bay Guy website</a>.

                <p>After 50 episodes of the podcast, I felt it was time to do something else. I had a blast with doing my podcast, and learned so much. I may do it again in the future, but wanted to focus some time and effort elsewhere. I landed on doing something with video. I liked the thought of challenging myself with a new medium. I landed on doing a cooking show, where I would make recipes that aligned with the opponent that the Packers were playing each week. Boy, did I severely underestimate how difficult it’d be to do a cooking show each and every week. The time commitment each episode required was much more than I had ever anticipated. I ended up making 14 different videos before decided I had to call it a day on my cooking videos for the time. Although, I'm very disappointed I didn't complete this goal as I wanted to,  I'm very happy I took on the challenge.</p>

                <p>If you’re reading this, I highly encourage taking on a side project of your own. Had I not started this side project I would have missed out on so much. Without starting this side project, I would have never had the opportunity to share the stories of so many. Without starting this side project, I would have never received photos and videos from people all over the world who watched my cooking show that replicated the dish. Finally, without starting this side project, I would have never been able to positively impact so many who come to Green Bay.

                <p>Before I end this, I’ll tell one quick story. During the previous football season, I was out to dinner with some friends who came into town from Pittsburgh. As we were leaving the restaurant, I see someone look at me and go, “That’s the guy”. As I got closer to his table (conveniently on our path out the restaurant), he asked me if I was The Green Bay Guy. I told him my name is Ben. He shook my hand and thanked me for suggesting the restaurant we were at. He had never heard of it, and told his family they should try it. They absolutely loved the place and look forward to going to it whenever they go to a game in the future. I thanked him for using the website and told him to enjoy the rest of his time in Green Bay. As we got into the car, I took great solace in knowing that I helped make another person’s trip just a little bit better. Go start that side project.
