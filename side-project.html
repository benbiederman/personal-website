            <h3>How I became known as <span class="tgbg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheGreenBayGuy" target="_blank">The Green Bay Guy</a></span> and how I grew because of it</h3>

            <div class="wrapper">
                <p>Midway through 2017 I found myself itching to take on a side hustle or side project of some sort. I was roughly a year removed from my skateboarding business that I had operated for four years, and felt like my days were becoming more mundane. My only issue is that I couldn’t figure out what I should do. I had really enjoyed starting and operating my skateboarding company, but once I moved to Green Bay the business fizzled out due to not having the same reputation in skateboarding in Green Bay as I did in my hometown. I spent a lot of time reading and listening to speeches on YouTube. <a href=” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80-gPkpH6M”>Jim Carrey’s commencement speech</a> really stuck with me. In his speech he states that you should ask the universe for what you want, and the universe will eventually listen. I thought it was a slightly odd idea, but I had nothing to lose. So, I asked the universe to help me find what I was looking for.</p>

                <p>A few weeks after making my ask, I get a notification on Twitter. Someone tweeted me, asking me if I could message them when I get a minute. I followed the person back and sent them a quick, “What’s up?". The gentleman, named Jordan, proceeds to send me a message asking for some advice. He was taking his Grandpa to a Packers game and they were on their way to Green Bay. They had some items planned as to what to do, but wanted to reach out to me in order to make sure they knew all the places to eat or see. They were wanting to get the full Green Bay experience, as this was his Grandpa’s first Lambeau Field experience and it was his Grandpa’s dream to see the Packers play at Lambeau Field. I was more than happy to assist Jordan with this request. I quickly sent him a list of all the places I’d recommend as places to eat, drink, or see while in town. As he experienced all of these places, he would message me to let me know what he thought of each. We ended up meeting at Lambeau Field on Sunday, where he thanked me for all the help and said it really made the trip great. It was a great feeling knowing that I was personally able to make a positive impact on someone’s trip to Green Bay.

                <p>The whole next week I kept thinking about Jordan reaching out and how great it was to make that trip more memorable for him and his grandpa. I thought to myself, if I could help Jordan, I’m sure there are a lot of others who I could help too. I concluded that a website focused solely on the best places to eat, drink, or see would be a fun little project. I sought out a name that was available on all socials, as well as an available domain. After striking out on a few names, The Green Bay Guy was the winner. Roughly a month later, my website was live. At the time, it had only a few reviews on it, but I figured it was better to launch it as quickly as possible, rather than waiting for it to be perfect. As of writing this, I now have over 50 reviews of different restaurants in the area.

                <p>The funny thing about side projects is how they continue to grow and develop. After a few months of building up a following on The Green Bay Guy, I thought of another idea. It stemmed from a visit to my grandma in her assisted living home. While there, one of the residents overheard I was from Green Bay. He proceeded to tell me that back in the 1940s he hitchhiked to Green Bay on two different occasions to watch Curly’s Packers take on the Lions and the Bears. I was in awe of the story and how farfetched the idea of hitchhiking over 200 miles to watch a football game was. After leaving I was reflecting on that story and how unique of a story it was. I was bummed to think that one day he would no longer be around to share that story, and ultimately the story would end with him. I then thought of how many other people have unique stories that they could share. With this thought, I concluded that a podcast that focuses on fans and their stories would be a really fun project to work on during the offseason. While I had never made a podcast before, I figured it was something I could figure out along the way. I quickly got to work on what the name would be, potential guests, and how I even upload a podcast. I won’t bore you with all of the details, but I quickly figured out what I was doing and some guests. I named the podcast The Green Bay Narrative. In total, I interviewed over 50 people to capture their stories. The podcast did exactly what I was hoping it would – captured some very unique stories. I was even fortunate enough to interview a few different Packers players and capture their stories. If you’d like to listen to any of the episodes, you can still find them on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thegreenbaynarrative" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> or on <a href="http://thegreenbayguy.com/podcast.html" target="_blank">The Green Bay Guy website</a>.
