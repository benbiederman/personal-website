            <h2 tabindex="0">Failure</h2>

            <p>Failure is such a funny thing. It seems we do all we can to avoid failure, even if that means holding off on dreams or aspirations. We get stuck into this rut of doing something day in and day out that doesn’t seem to fit our dreams and aspirations because we’re too scared to fail. In fact, for a lot of us, our brain will convince us whatever we set out to do is going to fail, even before we try. We worry that if we fail, we’re going to be humiliated. What will my friends think? What will my family think? Worst of all, we worry that people we don’t even know or like will find out about this failure and judge accordingly. I’m not afraid to admit that I’ve been in this situation before, and still am guilty of it at times. I’m writing this today to share a story with of you of one of my many failures and why it was one of the best things that’s ever happened to me.</p>

            <p>Back in January of 2014, I woke up one day with this nagging feeling that I should start a skateboarding business. As an avid skateboarder, it was always a dream of mine to have my own skateboarding company. As a kid, I would buy Tech Decks, scrape the paint off of them, draw my own designs, and then sell them to kids at school. I even had a name for my Tech Deck skateboards – Benbots. Anyway, that’s a story for another day. I had always had this dream to do my own skateboarding company, but my brain automatically would push that dream aside. The odd thing about dreams or goals is that you immediately start telling yourself all the ways you’re going to fail, or why it’s a bad idea. You make false assumptions to talk yourself out of taking any steps towards that dream or goal. With this idea to start a skateboarding company continuously nagging at me, I decided to do some research. I quickly learned that most of the reasons I had as to why it was a bad idea to start this business were false (granted, some were still true). After doing a bit of research, my excitement prevailed over my brain telling me not to do it. I decided that I’m starting a skateboarding company.</p>

            <p>Once I made that mental decision that I was starting this company, it was all I could think about. I immediately started brainstorming names. After a day or two of brainstorming I came up with a name that I enjoyed and that I thought flowed well – Wiscowood Skateboards (later I changed the name to Solace Skate Co, but that’s irrelevant for this story). I thought it paid a nice homage to my state, and rolled off the tongue nicely. I quickly scooped up the domain and socials and got to work on the logo and some design ideas. Along with figuring out my designs, I also had to figure out who was going to manufacturer these for me, I had a few different routes I could take. I started contacting each manufacturer to get an idea of how their processed worked. Eventually, I settled on a manufacturer out of California that offered great products at a fair price. I threw together my deck design using Photoshop, and placed my first order – I was on my way.</p>

                <figcaption>This was the very first skateboard I (poorly) designed in Photoshop. It was inspired by Enjoi Skateboards. Instead of pandas, I used cows. It's safe to say the designs got better over time, much like everything with my business.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>From my years of skateboarding, I knew that a successful skateboarding company can’t just sell boards. You also need some accessories like apparel, stickers, wax, etc. I quickly did some research on some accessories I could have to compliment my decks that I ordered and started working on those.</p>

            <p>The final step for me to kickstart my business was to create my online presence. I created all of the social pages, to help generate some buzz about the new company. All I had left was to create a website where I could sell my skateboards. I put together a pretty terrible Wix website, but it allowed individuals to make purchases, and that was all I really needed. I was officially in business!</p>

            <p>I ended up operating that business for a little over three years. During those three years I was able to have so many incredible experiences, and most importantly, I learned so much. By the time I had decided to move on to my next project, I had five skateboarders that I had sponsored; multiple skateboarding and apparel designs; my skateboards in a few different shops throughout Wisconsin; and I had gotten to know and work with some skateboarders that I idolized growing up, even my favorite pro skateboarder.</p>

                <figcaption>Here's a photo of two of my riders, Jake (left) and Cole (right). I wouldn't trade this experience for anything, it was such a blast. Sad that it ever had to come to an end, but all good things must end.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Despite all the successes I had with my company, on paper it was a failure. Over the few years I lost a few thousand dollars. I had skateboards that would warp due to not selling quickly enough. My apparel designs grew stale due to not being able to continuously add new designs or sell the designs I did have. I underpriced my product in hopes to pick up sales, but ultimately just ate into my profits. However, what I lost in money or product, I gained in knowledge and insight. Had I never started my skateboarding business, there would have been so many things I would still be oblivious to today. By starting and managing my skateboarding company I learned so much and got to experience so much. Without starting this company, I may have never learned about drop shipping and the pros and cons that come with that. I may have never been able to attend a city council meeting to plead my case for a skateboarding contest at our local skatepark. I may have never found my interest in web design and development. Most importantly, without starting my skateboarding business, I’d still be wondering what it would have been like to start a skateboarding company. It’d still be nothing more than a dream.</p>

            <figure class="in-blog-img">

                <figcaption>The local newspaper, The Leader Telegram, heard about the skateboarding competition we were hosting and wanted to interview me for it. A really cool outcome from this failure.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>I tell you this very long story not to brag about starting this company or all that I was able to do because of it, but to show you how easy it is to try your dream, even if only for a few years. My business failed after only a few years, but the funny part is, no one gave a shit. Still to do this day people reference how gnarly it was that I started that skateboarding company and how much they loved my products/designs. I don’t regret for one second starting this business or losing that money. If anything, when I reflect on those times, I can’t help but smile because of how fun of an experience it was. I implore you to go out and experience your dreams or goals, don’t worry about who is watching. I’ll tell you a secret, no one is watching, they’re all focused what they’re doing to notice what you’re doing.</p>

            <p>If on the odd chance you’re starting a skateboarding company and have any questions – feel free to email me. I’d be more than happy to share my insights and help in any way possible.</p>
