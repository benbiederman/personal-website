            <h2 tabindex="0">Project: Pokedex</h2>

            <p>I love nostalgia. There is just something so great about reminiscing on our childhood and what we loved as kids. Recently, my friend Tom and I have been having nostalgia days. During these nostalgia days, we’ll get together and enjoy some of the things we grew up loving: unhealthy food, late 90s / early 2000s TV shows, and Pokemon – a lot of Pokemon. Tom and I both grew up absolutely OBSESSED with Pokemon. My Game Boy Color with a cartridge of Pokemon Red, Pokemon Blue, or Pokemon Yellow, never left my side. I’ll always remember the car rides at night, where I had to hold my Game Boy above my head in hopes of capturing some light from the car’s headlights behind us. During our nostalgia days we started playing Pokemon on our Game Boy again, and the memories came rushing back. The dream I had as a kid to catch all 151 Pokemon was a real one, it was one of the first goals I can remember having. I have to admit, as an adult, that dream is still alive and well.</p>

            <p>I tell this story to give a bit of insight on this project. During one of these nostalgia days, I found myself somewhat annoyed with an aspect of the game, one I didn’t enjoy as a kid either… the Pokedex. If you’ve ever played Pokemon Red, Pokemon Blue, or Pokemon Yellow on Game Boy, you know exactly what I’m talking about. You have to scroll through the entire list to see what you’ve caught and what you haven’t. How am I supposed to catch ‘em all when I’m wasting all this valuable time scrolling through my Pokedex?! Then I thought of a great idea, instead of just spending 10 minutes writing out a list, I’ll spend hours and build my own Pokedex!</p>

            <p>As far as my vision for this project, I’d like to keep the Pokedex simple. I think it should also look somewhat like it came out of that era, utilizing fonts that are similar in style to the games. There will be a search bar that allows you to search for any Pokemon by name or number. When you search for the Pokemon, it’ll give you the basic information about that Pokemon. I also plan on building another page where I document my journey as I try to catch ‘em all on my Pokemon Red game. On this page, I’ll have all 151 Pokemon listed. If the Pokemon has been caught, the picture will be in full color, otherwise it’ll be a grayscale image. This should work as an easy indication to determine which Pokemon I’m missing. I also want the ability to filter the Pokemon by if they've been caught or not.</p>

            <p>I’m sure this project will take me a while to complete as I’m working on other things while doing it, but it just seems like too fun of a project to not do, no matter how much I have on my plate right now. Be sure to check back periodically, I’ll post it in my portfolio when it’s complete. Also – once it is completed, check back in periodically to see how I’m coming along in my goal to catch ‘em all!</p>
