            <h2 tabindex="0">2021.25</h2>

            <p>Wow! We’re already a quarter of the way through 2021. It’s unreal how quickly time seems to be going the older I get. Anyway, I wanted to give a brief update as to what I’ve been up to for the first three months of this year. I figured doing one of these updates every quarter would be a good way to monitor my progress and see that I’m on the right path to reach the goals I set out at the beginning of the year.</p>

            <p>For 2021 I seem to set pretty modest goals. The goals I set were mostly fun little goals like read 25 books, create a recipe book, or document all personal finances in an excel spreadsheet – sadly, yes, I do consider that last goal fun. However, there was one goal that was much more sizable and harder to achieve than any of my other goals I set out for 2021. This goal is the reason I kept the others rather light, to allow me to focus a lot more attention and effort on my main goal. That main goal is to land a role as a front-end web developer, junior or otherwise.</p>

            <p>This goal of landing a front-end developer role is going to take quite a bit for me to achieve. I’m dealing with a handful of obstacles that will take a fair amount of effort (and luck) to overcome. There are really two big issues that stand in my way of achieving this goal:</p>

            <h6>Location</h6>
            <p>The first issue is where I live. I’m in a location where there isn’t a ton of opportunities in this space. My area is more known for manufacturing than tech. There are some options that come up, however they’re very few and far between. The options that do come up tend to be looking for individuals who have years of experience.</p>

            <p>My plan to overcome this obstacle is simple – be patience, keep working. I’ll continue to monitor job postings, but while I’m waiting for my opportunity to arise, I’ll keep working and learning. Eventually an opportunity will come available that I’m qualified for. I’m fortunate enough to have a job, so I have no pressure to find a job immediately. I can take my time and find a position that’s going to be a good fit for all parties.</p>

            <p>Another way to overcome this obstacle is by browsing remote options. This is a bit tougher of an option as a lot of postings I’m seeing are labeled as remote opportunities but then you see that it’s remote after so long or it’s only remote until the pandemic is over. The opportunities that are 100% remote have fierce competition with hundreds of applications per posting, so my plan to overcome this obstacle is the same as my other plan – be patience, keep working. If I see something that interests me, I’ll apply and expect that I won’t hear anything back due to the sizeable response they get per posting. If I hear back, great, otherwise I’ll just keep working.</p>

            <h6>Self-Taught</h6>
            <p>Another issue I think I’ll run into a lot, especially as I apply to more roles is my lack of degree. Maybe I’m mistaken, but I feel like my lack of CS degree is going to hinder me in my search. Being 100% self-taught has its perks, but it also has its flaws. My biggest concern is not knowing what I don’t know. In college they run you through a lot of courses and get you very well rounded for that specific career. As a self-taught individual, I don’t have that same level of understanding for a lot of those different, minor subjects. Another concern I have is that I’ve never had my code reviewed. I code my projects to the best of my abilities but it’s difficult to know if you’re doing something that’s not right without someone more experienced looking over it and giving you feedback.</p>

            <p>To overcome this obstacle, my motto will just continue to be the same – be patience, keep working. I wake up every morning at 04:15 – 04:30 in order to get 3 hours of studying/coding in before I go to my job. I also study/code for another hour or so every night. Eventually I’ll hit a tipping point where my skills are at a high enough level for a company to take a chance on me, even if some of my code is ugly or I’m not as well rounded as someone with a CS degree. There are definitely days I get discouraged but if I keep working, I’ll eventually get there.</p>

            <p>Understanding these obstacles has helped me work towards overcoming them in the first quarter of this year. I’m very aware that I may not achieve my goal this year, but I’m more than okay with that. Each quarter I look to grow and develop my skills to help me show the value I can provide to a company. During this quarter, Q1 of 2021, I was able to do a few different things to assist me in my growth.</p>
            
            <p>One of the major things that benefitted me this quarter was having the opportunity to sit down and talk with an experienced web dev. He had over 15 years in the business and allowed me to pick his brain for about 45 minutes. He gave me tips on languages I should be focusing on, as well as some insight on ways I could increase my chances of getting a junior web dev role. It was extremely beneficial and I’m very grateful for him taking the time. I doubt you’ll ever read this, but thanks Jason!</p>

            <p>Along with this meeting, I also worked on a couple different projects for my portfolio and worked on learning some new languages to compliment my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. I hope during Q2 that I can gain further knowledge in these languages and start showing them in my portfolio with projects I build.</p>

            <p>This post turned out a lot longer than I had originally anticipated, but being that it was the first update I wanted to lay a bit of groundwork of the obstacles I was looking at. I don’t foresee any other updates this year being nearly as long, but never say never! I’ll end with one of my favorite quotes, as it seems very applicable for this post.</p>
