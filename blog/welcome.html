            <h2 tabindex="0">A blog! I guess?</h2>

            <p>Recently I’ve been thinking about starting a blog for my website. By no means would I consider myself a blogger, nor would I say writing exciting pieces of content is a strength of mine, but I think it would quite beneficial for me to do.  There are two big reasons why I think adding a blog to this website would be beneficial for me.</p>

            <p>The first reason is that currently my web presence is next to nothing. I no longer have a personal Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter that I use. I have a LinkedIn account, but depending on when you talk to me, it may be inactivated. Having a blog would allow individuals to keep up to date with what I’m doing or get to know me more. I have a small about me section on my website, but a blog would allow people to not just scratch the surface, but get to know who I am a bit more. I don’t plan on sharing my entire life through this medium, but it’ll at least allow a glimpse into my world.</p>

            <p>The other reason that I think starting a blog would be beneficial is to allow me to reflect back on the progress I’ve made in my personal development. So often it seems that you overlook all the progress you’ve made on your journey and instead focus on how far away you are from where you think you should be. You see how far ahead others are, and you beat yourself up based on where they are in their journey. I’m trying to focus more on comparing myself to where I was yesterday, last week, last month, or last year, instead of where someone else is.</p>

            <p>You may be wondering what you can expect from this blog. Well… you’re probably not wondering that, but I’m going to tell you anyway. My plan is to upload a new post every couple of weeks. The posts will be focused around projects I’m working on, success that I’ve had, failures I’ve endured, and anything else I feel like talking about. I look forward to sharing these stories with you and hope you enjoy reading them as well.</p>

                <p>Hi, I’m Ben. I’m an individual who is focused on being better today than I was yesterday. By doing things that are outside of my comfort zone, I’m slowly figuring out what I want to be when I grow up.</p>
