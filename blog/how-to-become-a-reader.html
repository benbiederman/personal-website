            <p>Prior to 2016 I couldn’t be bothered with a book. I hadn’t read a book willingly since my childhood. The only ones I’d read were because they were assigned to me in class, and even then I’d usually just get the spark notes instead of reading them. In 2016 that changed though, I made it a mission to learn how to start reading books. I don’t mean reading books as in reading the words, I obviously knew how to do that already, I wanted to learn how to start reading books and really getting a lot out of it. I set out a rather adventurous goal of reading one book a week, 52 books in 52 weeks. I was quickly surprised by what I encountered on this journey. If you’re on the same mission as I was, here’s how I became a reader.</p>

            <h6>Get excited about reading</h6>
            <p>To start my journey, I knew if I wanted to be successful I had to change my current mindset. Anytime I thought about reading, my mind automatically correlated reading with all the times you were forced to read a book for an assignment in school, regardless of your interest level in the book. To combat this, I knew I would have find some books that really excited me to read them. I decided to take a couple of hours and go explore my local Barnes and Noble. I wanted to take my time and go through every section of books so I could find that book that made me excited to read it. After exploring I found a few books that I was eager to start reading.</p>
